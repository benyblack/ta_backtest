## TA Backtesting

Goals of the project
1. To build a framework for myself to implement different back testing scenarios easily. 
2. Trying to code in functional programming style with python (which is a bit difficult)

I am going to change my mind about this and start to convert it to Elixir which is more suitable for functional style. But I will need some parts remain in python.

### Sample output on RSI simple strategy:
